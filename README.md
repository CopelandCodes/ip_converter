# Overview

I developed this IP Address Converter program in Rust to deepen my understanding of Rust’s syntax, module system, and type system while building a math-based application. The program allows users to convert IP addresses between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations, showcasing the language’s support for string manipulation, numeric formatting, and modular design. I also wanted to learn about unit testing and ensure the code is well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain.


# Development Environment

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Compiler: Rust (installed via rustup)

Language: Rust (Edition 2024)

Tooling:

cargo for building and running the project

cargo test for running unit tests

cargo fmt for automatic code formatting

# Future Work

- Improve input validation to handle incomplete or malformed IP addresses more gracefully.
- Implement support for IPv6 address conversion.
- Add command-line argument support so users can run conversions directly without using interactive prompts.
- Extend unit tests to cover more edge cases and invalid input scenarios.
